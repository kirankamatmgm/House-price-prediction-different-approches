# House price prediction
I have solved Kaggle problem House price regression using 2 methods.

## First method
- Traditional and most important way of solving
- Apply machine learning techniques like preprocessing and all other feature engineering steps
- And then applied random forest and also tried xgboost
- xgboost worked fine.

## Second method
- apply neural network to solve problem. 
- for this I tried fastai library
